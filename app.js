   sign-in ("What's new"), and `winver` in the Terminal reports the version. */

const WC_CHANGELOG = {
  "2.0.2": [
    "🔎 winclone.search_file(\"notes.txt\") — Python can search the whole disk now and get back a list of full paths. Part of a name works, and so do wildcards: search_file(\"*.py\") finds every script you own.",
    "🛑 winclone.terminate_task(\"Notepad\") — a script can end a running task. Names aren't fussy about case, and part of a name is enough.",
    "📋 winclone.tasks() — everything Task Manager is showing, as a list, so a script can look before it kills.",
    "🛡️ Scripts get the same rules the End task button does: system processes are refused, and malware refuses too — a rootkit just respawns it, so that's still Cork Defender's job.",
  ],
  "2.0.0": [
    "📧 WinClone Mail. Every account gets a real address — the name from the email you signed up with, in front of @winclone.com — and you can mail any other WinClone user. Open it once to pick your address; you don't have to use your real name.",
    "📬 Mail arrives live. No refreshing: a message lands with a notification and a red badge on the taskbar while you're doing something else.",
    "📎 Attach a file and it arrives as a real file. Save it to Downloads and it's back to being a .py script, a picture, a text file — whatever it was on their machine. (Imported music is too big to post.)",
    "☁️ Your inbox belongs to your account, not to a PC, so it's the same on all three and costs none of their storage.",
    "🚦 Limits, so nobody can bury you: 1000 characters a message, 1 MB a file, 3 mails a minute and 60 an hour.",

    "☁️ Your PC saves itself to your account as you use it, and again on shut down, restart or sign out.",

    "🐍 Python can play it too: winclone.open_app(\"C:/Users/User/Music/song.mp3\") opens the track and starts it.",
    "🗄️ Songs are far too big for the 5 MB WinClone normally lives in, so they're kept in the browser's larger store and the file system only holds a pointer. Settings ▸ Storage shows how much music you're carrying.",

    "🔄 winclone.reboot() — a Python script can restart the whole PC and keep running through it. Everything closes, the boot splash spins, the lock screen comes back, and when you sign in the script is still going, with all its variables. Rebooting no longer saves you.",

    "🧱 Tilemaps and a real platformer physics helper - g.tilemap() builds a level from text art, g.move_aabb() walks and lands a box on solid tiles for you, gravity and all.",
    "🧊 wcgame can do 3D now. g.mesh_cube/mesh_plane/mesh_sphere/mesh/terrain build geometry, g.cam3d/orbit_cam3d/light3d set up a camera and a light, and g.draw3d renders it - a small perspective-projected, depth-sorted, flat-shaded software renderer, right on the same canvas as everything else.",
    "🏔️ g.terrain() + g.terrain_height() + g.ground3d() give you a walkable heightmap with gravity, jumping and ground-snapping - the actual hard part of a 3D platformer, done for you.",
    "🏗️ engine.py - a small object-oriented layer on top of wcgame: Entity/Sprite/PlatformerEntity objects with update()/draw(), a Scene that owns them, and an Engine that runs a scene stack (menu, play, pause) for you. import engine and subclass it, same as any other module in Documents\\Python.",
    "📚 Three new examples in Documents\\Python: platformer.py (a real 2D level with tiles, camera scroll and particles), world3d.py (a 3D scene you walk and jump around in), and engine.py (run it directly for a tiny menu + bouncing-entities demo).",

    "➕ New Python file commands — winclone.append(), winclone.exists(), winclone.new_file() and winclone.del_file() (add permanent=True to skip the Recycle Bin and really free the space).",
    "📂 winclone.open_app() opens anything now — an app, a file, or a folder, using whatever normally handles it.",
    "🙋 winclone.set_user_name() renames your account from a script, everywhere at once.",

    "⌨️ A window switcher on Alt+Tab (Windows usually eats that one, so Alt+` does the same). Ctrl+Alt+←/→ changes desktop, Ctrl+Alt+↑ opens Task View.",

    "🧱 A proper Windows 10 Start menu: power rail on the left, alphabetical app list, and colorful live tiles.",
    "📥 Action center — notifications slide in from the right edge, and toasts pop up above the tray.",
    "🔷 A real boot screen with the zigzag WinClone logo and spinning dots, plus startup / notification / error sounds.",

   Each window record carries a .vd saying which desktop it lives on, and the
   taskbar only lists the current one.

   swapped for a placeholder.

   On keyboard shortcuts: Windows itself swallows Alt+Tab and every Win-key

   back should never change how you sign in — and it doesn't touch the installed

   Snapshots live in the same localStorage as everything else, so they cost real

   a broken screen — every effect is applied to the real, live desktop, so your
   windows keep working (badly) underneath it.

   How it works: warping effects write a combined transform/filter onto <body>,
   which drags the desktop, the taskbar and every open window along with them.
   Overlay effects draw into #scrfx, a full-screen layer pinned above the shell
   but below the BSOD and the BIOS — those two stay readable on purpose, because
   the BIOS is the escape hatch of last resort.

   The engine costs nothing when idle: no timers, no rAF, no canvases. Turning
   the last effect off tears the whole layer back down. */

/* ============================ PYTHON ============================

   Generators are the whole trick. Every eval/exec here is a generator, so the
   driver can pause a running script between steps and hand the browser back.
   That's what makes `while True:` game loops safe (the tab never freezes),
   input() able to wait for a keystroke, and wcgame.flip() able to wait for the
   next animation frame.

   It is NOT CPython. No real int/float split (4/2 prints 2, not 2.0), no
   threads, no C modules, no real file IO, no operator overloading beyond
   __init__/__str__. Plenty for scripts and little games. */

    <code>winclone.ls(folder)</code> · <code>winclone.read(name)</code> · <code>winclone.exists(name)</code><br>
    <code>winclone.write(name, text)</code> — if that name is taken it makes
    <code>name (2)</code> instead of replacing it, and returns the name it used<br>
    <code>winclone.write(name, text, overwrite=True)</code> — replace the existing one<br>
    <code>winclone.append(name, text)</code> — adds to the end, creates it if missing<br>
    <code>winclone.new_file(name, text)</code> — same as plain write, named for when
    making a new copy is the whole point<br>
    <code>winclone.del_file(name)</code> — to the Recycle Bin; add
    <code>permanent=True</code> to skip the bin and actually free the space, or
    <code>missing_ok=True</code> to shrug when it's already gone<br>
    <code>winclone.open_app(x)</code> (or <code>winclone.open</code>) — an app id opens the app,
    anything else opens that file or folder with whatever handles it<br>
    <code>winclone.search_file("notes.txt")</code> — searches the <b>whole disk</b> and gives
    back a list of full paths. Part of a name works too, and so do wildcards:
    <code>search_file("*.py")</code><br>
    <code>winclone.tasks()</code> — everything Task Manager is showing, as a list of names<br>
    <code>winclone.terminate_task("Notepad")</code> — ends that task. Same rules as the
    End task button: apps close, system processes are refused, and malware throws
    <code>PermissionError</code> because a rootkit just respawns it — that one's
    Cork Defender's job<br>
    <code>winclone.open_app("C:/Users/User/Music/song.mp3")</code> — opens a track in Media
    Player and <b>really plays it</b>, if you imported it from your computer
    (File Explorer ▸ right-click ▸ <i>Import files…</i>)<br>
    <code>winclone.show_py_window(False)</code> — hide the window this script runs in,
    Stop button and all; <code>show_py_window(True)</code> brings it back. The script
    keeps running the whole time<br>
    <code>winclone.reboot()</code> — restarts the PC <b>without ending your script</b>:
    every window closes, the boot splash spins, the lock screen comes back, and once you
    sign in your script carries on at the next line with all its variables still set.

/* ---- Macrohard Edgy: the default browser ----
   Edge (above) is the original, and stays - some sites (and some old habits)
   still expect it. Edgy is the real one now: typing a search on its home
   page or address bar shows real, live web results right inside the window,
   instead of Edge's simulated ones. It points its iframe at a small proxy
   on a separately-hosted AI backend: that server calls a real search API
   and hands results back from its own domain, which sets no framing
   restriction (an actual search engine's results page would refuse to be
   framed directly). Typed URLs and bookmarks load the same way, straight in
   a sandboxed iframe - the same technique Edge uses for real sites like
   Wikipedia - and sites that refuse to be framed (Google, YouTube,
   Instagram, ...) get a graceful "won't load here" screen with a proxy
   fallback instead of a dead end.

   Also has: light/dark mode, page zoom, real history, incognito tabs, a tab
   overflow menu, drag-to-reorder tabs, live favicons, and a collapsible AI
   sidebar that embeds the same backend's chat assistant. */

   its chat page as the AI sidebar, and also uses its /search route (a real
   search API, proxied so results can be framed) for search results, and its
   /proxy route as a fallback for sites that block framing directly or fail

     history/back-button flow instead of just vanishing into the iframe.

/* ============================ WINCLONE ACCOUNT ============================
   Two different sign-ins live in this file and they are NOT the same thing:

     • The WinClone Account (this section) is real. Email + password or Google,
       handled by Supabase, and it decides which saved PCs you get to see.
     • The lock screen (next section) is a toy. It's per-PC, it's scrambled not
       hashed, and it's part of what a PC *is* — like a sticker on the case.

   A "PC" is a row in the `pcs` table whose `data` is a snapshot of every wc_*
   key in localStorage. Switching PCs writes that snapshot back into localStorage
   and reloads the page, because all the state up top (VFS, RECYCLE, ICONPOS…)
   hydrates once at script load — a reload is by far the honest way to swap it,
   and it happens to look exactly like a real machine restarting.

   The anon key below is meant to be public. It only says "I am some member of
   the public"; the database's row-level security is what stops one account from

   live, so it is deliberately absent from the wc_ snapshot: the same inbox
   follows you onto all three PCs and never spends a byte of their ~5 MB.

   Two tables back it. `profiles` maps an account to the handle in front of
   @winclone.com and doubles as the address book — any signed-in user can read
   it, which is how you look somebody up. `mail` holds the messages, and RLS
   only ever hands you rows where you are the sender or the recipient.

   Attachments do NOT live in the database. A 1 MB file base64'd into a text
   column would fill the whole 500 MB after ~360 of them, so the bytes go to a
   private Storage bucket (its own 1 GB quota) and the row keeps only a path. */
